      <h2>Welcome to Math Tutoring Service</h2>
      
      <p>Hi, my name is Dinh and I'm a math teacher with a passion for helping students succeed. I've spent the past 7 years teaching math at private high schools (Polytechnic in Pasadena and currently at Sage Hill in Newport Beach), and I hold a bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley and a PhD from USC.
      </p>

      <p>I know that math can be tough, but I believe that every student has the potential to excel. That's why I offer personalized tutoring sessions that are tailored to your specific needs and learning style. I'm here to help you get the most out of every session and see progress in your math class.
      </p>
    
      <p>If you're struggling to keep up in class, looking to improve your grades, or simply want to get ahead, I'm here to help. Send me a message  at <a href="mailto: mathtutorDinh@gmail.com">mathtutorDinh@gmail.com</a> and let's schedule a tutoring session. I promise we'll have a great time and you'll leave feeling more confident and capable in math.
